# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.

# What I Did

- Loaded and cleaned the dataset from Kaggle
- Visualized important features (Age, Annual Income, Spending Score)
- Applied K-Means clustering with elbow method to find optimal clusters
- Plotted customer segments

# Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

# Dataset

Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)

# Output Plots

Added in the repository for reference (e.g. scatter plots showing clusters).

# Learnings

- Clustering techniques
- Data visualization
- Real-world unsupervised learning use cas
